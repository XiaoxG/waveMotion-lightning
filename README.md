Wavemotion-lightning-- a demonstration code for wave motion prediction of an offshore platform. 

Refers to preprint Arvix: "Probabilistic prediction of the heave motions of a semi-submersible by a deep learning model" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00873)

This notebook demonstrates the learning process of the provided model.

Note: since very few data was provided, the performance of the model is poor.

More data will be public soon.

The model could be trained in this notebook file, or use traditional python file (main.py). A Dockerfile is also provided for more convenient way to train the model. If you have basic knowledge of docker, it is preferred to train the model inside docker.
